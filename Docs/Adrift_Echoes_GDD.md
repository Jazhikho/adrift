## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
### 1.1 High Concept
A survival tragedy set upon an infinite ocean where the line between starvation and revelation blurs.
You drift alone in a liferaft after the end. Food, water, and hope slowly fade. As your body weakens, the waves begin to whisper, showing visions that might be memories—or hallucinations. There is no victory condition; the only goal is endurance.

### 1.2 Game Overview
- **Genre:** Survival / Psychological Horror / Narrative Exploration
- **Target Platform(s):** PC (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Target Audience:** Mature players, ages 16+; fans of narrative survival and slow existential horror
- **Target Rating:** Teen / Mature (themes of isolation, starvation, mental collapse)
- **Comparable Titles:** Raft, ABZÛ, Return of the Obra Dinn, SOMA, Dear Esther
- **Unique Selling Points:**
  - No win condition—only endurance and acceptance
  - Hallucinations and echoes dynamically tied to survival states
  - Atmospheric storytelling through ocean, sound, and light

### 1.3 Design Pillars
1. Endurance Without Victory — The player endures, but cannot conquer the sea.
2. The Ocean Is the Antagonist — Nature, not narrative, drives tension.
3. Psychological Degradation — Starvation births hallucinations that merge sound, light, and memory.
4. Minimalism as Honesty — Fewer mechanics, deeper emotional resonance.

## 2. GAME CONCEPT
### 2.1 Story & Setting
#### 2.1.1 Narrative Synopsis
You awaken alone in a liferaft, adrift on a boundless sea. Early on, you gather floating debris and catch rain. As days pass, supplies dwindle, and the waves begin to speak. You start to see other rafts, other survivors—none are real. Eventually, you either fade quietly into the calm or hallucinate rescue.

#### 2.1.2 World / Setting
A procedural, day-night-cycled ocean rendered with simple shaders. No visible land. The raft, the sky, and the water are the entire world.

#### 2.1.3 Tone & Theme
Bleak serenity; cosmic insignificance. Themes of endurance, denial, and dissolution.

### 2.2 Core Gameplay Loop
1. Scavenge
2. Consume
3. Maintain
4. Endure
5. Deteriorate
6. End

### 2.3 Player Experience Goals
- Feel the futility of endurance.
- Sense awe and dread at the living sea.
- Question the boundaries between mind and environment.

## 3. GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
### 3.1 Core Mechanics

At low coherence, ocean sounds transform into human voices or music. Visual mirages appear.

#### 3.1.3 Ocean & Wave Mechanics
Procedurally animated ocean; wave height linked to weather and emotional state.

#### 3.1.4 Maintenance
Simple input rhythm mechanic for patching leaks or tightening ropes.

### 3.2 Game Controls

- Interact: E
- Inventory: Tab
- Ping: Q
- Rest: R
- Pause: Esc

### 3.3 Camera System
First-person, smooth sway synced to raft tilt.

## 4. GAME SYSTEMS
### 4.1 Progression System
Time-based degradation. Unlocks: hallucination tiers, altered lighting.

### 4.2 Resource Management
